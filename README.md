This is StudySpot, I created this project that utilises Firebase & Google Gemini, developed in Java using Android Studio.

This is a simple app that allows users to create and manage subjects and create flashcards under different topics that they can use for revision.

Google Gemini was utilised to allow users to automatically generate flashcards.

Utilising Firebase, you are able to view your flashcards and topics offline and online. This clever study app does not also not require a log in.
